# lps-construction-for-KMP
Constructing the lps (longest prefix as suffix) array for KMP string matching


In the preprocessing part, we calculate values in lps[]. To do that, we keep track of the length of the longest prefix suffix value (we use len variable for this purpose) for the previous index. We initialize lps[0] and len as 0. If pat[len] and pat[i] match, we increment len by 1 and assign the incremented value to lps[i]. If pat[i] and pat[len] do not match and len is not 0, we update len to lps[len-1]. See computeLPSArray () in the below code for details.

Illustration of preprocessing (or construction of lps[])

pat[] = "AAACAAAA"

len = 0, i  = 0.
lps[0] is always 0, we move 
to i = 1

len = 0, i  = 1.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] match, do len++, 
store it in lps[i] and do i++.
len = 1, lps[1] = 1, i = 2

len = 1, i  = 2.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] match, do len++, 
store it in lps[i] and do i++.
len = 2, lps[2] = 2, i = 3

len = 2, i  = 3.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] do not match, and len > 0, 
set len = lps[len-1] = lps[1] = 1

len = 1, i  = 3.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] do not match and len > 0, 
len = lps[len-1] = lps[0] = 0

len = 0, i  = 3.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] do not match and len = 0, 
Set lps[3] = 0 and i = 4.
We know that characters pat
len = 0, i  = 4.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] match, do len++, 
store it in lps[i] and do i++.
len = 1, lps[4] = 1, i = 5

len = 1, i  = 5.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] match, do len++, 
store it in lps[i] and do i++.
len = 2, lps[5] = 2, i = 6

len = 2, i  = 6.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] match, do len++, 
store it in lps[i] and do i++.
len = 3, lps[6] = 3, i = 7

len = 3, i  = 7.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] do not match and len > 0,
set len = lps[len-1] = lps[2] = 2

len = 2, i  = 7.
Since pat[len] and pat[i] match, do len++, 
store it in lps[i] and do i++.
len = 3, lps[7] = 3, i = 8

We stop here as we have constructed the whole lps[].
